# tic-tac-toe
 In this project, the team will create a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses) game.

Project: Command-Line Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Project Overview:
In this project, the team will develop a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the command-line interface. The goal is to create a functional game that allows two players to take turns and determine the winner.

Project Requirements:

1. Game Logic:

Implement the game logic for a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Tic Tac Toe

Create a 3x3 grid to represent the game board.
Allow players to take turns, marking the grid with 'X' and 'O'.
Check for a winning condition (3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a draw 
(when the grid is full with no winner).


2. User Interface:

We will not build a UI as such.  Instead, we will print the current game board to the console after each move.
Prompt players to input their moves (e.g., "Player 1, enter your move (row and column): ").
Provide feedback on the game's progress, such as displaying the winner or indicating a draw.

3. Input Validation:

Implement input validation to ensure that players enter valid moves within the grid's bounds.
Handle scenarios where players attempt to make moves on already occupied cells.

4. Pair Programming:

Teams will work in pairs (or trios, depending on team size) with each pair responsible for different aspects of the project 
(e.g., game logic and user interface).

5.  Project Structure:
These four classes may be helpful in your app

src/
|-- TicTacToeGame.java (Main Class)
|-- Board.java (Class for managing the game board)
|-- Player.java (Class representing a player)
|-- GameLogic.java (Class for implementing the game rules)


Project Guidelines:

Emphasize the importance of communication and collaboration during pair programming. 
Team members should discuss their design decisions and coordinate their work effectively.

Suggest that the team begins with a simple, working version of the game and gradually adds enhancements or improvements as time allows.
